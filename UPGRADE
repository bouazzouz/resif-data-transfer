# UPGRADING
#

For safety, backup your current installation directory.

Download the new tarball and move it to your current installation
directory. E.g, if your installation is in /home/sysop/resif-data-transfer, 
move the tarball to /home/sysop. Then, extract :

$ tar xvf resif-data-transfer.tar.gz

This will replace your previous installation. Your configuration and log 
files will not be replaced.

#
# AFTER UPGRADING
#

Run a test transfer (using -t) to check your configuration file.
Run a logbook dump (using -l) to check your logbook.
